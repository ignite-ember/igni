"""Process-split RPC contract.

The RPC seam separates the in-process backend from an out-of-process
FE. :class:`RPCRequest` is straightforward. The response was
previously a single :class:`RPCResponse` class carrying
``result: Any + error: str | None`` — the "either ``result`` or
``error``, never both" invariant was un-enforced and callers
relied on convention.

This module replaces that with a Literal-tagged discriminated
union:

* :class:`RPCSuccess` — ``type: "rpc_success"``, always ``result``.
* :class:`RPCFailure` — ``type: "rpc_failure"``, always ``error``.

For wire-compat with existing FE clients that parse the
``"rpc_response"`` discriminator + ``.result`` / ``.error``
fields, :class:`RPCResponse` is preserved as-is (with the same
type literal and permissive semantics). New producer sites should
use :func:`rpc_ok` / :func:`rpc_fail` factory helpers, which
return the appropriate arm and Pydantic serialises them to the
same ``"rpc_response"`` type literal via the ``type`` alias.

TODO — ``RPCRequest.args`` stays ``dict[str, Any]``. Tightening
this would need one Pydantic model per RPC method — deferred
until the method surface is closed.
