"""Base :class:`Message` envelope + shared value objects.

Every wire message inherits from :class:`Message`; every run-scoped
event carries the ``(run_id, parent_run_id)`` pair captured by
:class:`RunHeader`.

Design note — MIXIN, not embedded field
---------------------------------------
An earlier iteration proposed embedding a ``header: RunHeader``
sub-object on every run-scoped event. That would have nested the
wire JSON from flat ``{run_id, parent_run_id}`` to
``{header: {run_id, parent_run_id}}`` — breaking every FE client
(React web, Tauri, VSCode, JetBrains, TUI) that parses those
fields at the top level.

The mixin approach avoids that: :class:`RunScopedMessage`
inherits from :class:`Message` and adds ``run_id`` + ``parent_run_id``
directly, so the wire stays flat. The :meth:`RunScopedMessage.header`
convenience method materialises a :class:`RunHeader` on demand for
callers that want the value object.
