"""Pydantic schemas for the project-initializer package.

Owns every wire model this package writes to disk plus the value
objects that replace the old raw-dict blobs and module-level
constants inside ``core/init.py`` (Rule 1 — no dict literals for
structured payloads, Rule 5 — no module-level mutable state).

Wire shapes:

* :class:`SettingsFile` — the fields of ``.igni/settings.json`` /
  ``.igni/settings.local.json`` this package touches (``hooks`` +
  ``permissions``). ``extra="allow"`` preserves user-added top-level
  keys (``mcpServers``, ``env``, …) across a load-then-save cycle
  so this package's writes never nuke keys owned by other subsystems.
* :class:`HomeConfig` / :class:`HomeModelSection` /
  :class:`HomeModelRegistryEntry` — the fields of
  ``~/.igni/config.yaml`` the home-config migrator inspects. Also
  ``extra="allow"`` so unknown user overrides round-trip untouched.
* :class:`BuiltInHookSpec` — one built-in hook shipped by the package
  (script content + settings.json registration). Grew ``write_script``
  and ``register_in`` methods so the spec owns its own provisioning
  instead of being pushed through a free ``_provision_hooks`` function.
* :class:`InitConfig` — replaces the old module-level ``PACKAGE_DIR``
  / ``MARKER_FILE`` / ``CHECKSUMS_FILE`` / ``DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS``
  constants. Tests inject an alternative ``package_dir`` via
  constructor arg (Rule 5 — no monkey-patch on a module attribute).
* :class:`InitResult` / :class:`MigrationResult` — typed replacements
  for the old ``bool`` / swallowed-``Exception`` returns; give callers
  structured access to what happened during ``run()``.
